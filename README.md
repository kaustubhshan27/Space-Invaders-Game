# Space-Invaders-Game
Created an arcade-style game based on the classic Space Invaders using the TI-TM4C123 ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller and a Nokia 5110 LCD graphics display. The user can control the movement of the spaceship using a potentiometer and can shoot missiles at the enemy spaceships using push buttons. The user has to kill all the enemy spaceships and avoid getting shot by the enemy spaceships to win the game with a maximum score.
